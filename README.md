fetching data
Good day! 

I would like to apologize if i wasn't able to deliver or execute my coding skill earlier

So now, i created a simple app wherein when i click the fetchdata button, it will give you a name and email so how did i do it?

first i check the API given earlier and observe but again i really cant understand the details on it, so i just get the name and email of the users

so first i declare userData it will be the one to get the user from the fetched data

then to be able to make the backend or the API seen in my frontend, i use fetch. so with the use of this i should be able to make my backend visible to my frontend (with the use of hte useEffect it will be the one to call the fetchData)

i created a button and place the fetchData there so that everytime that the  button is clicked the data of the user should change

now i used the code on the lower part to check if the code is true or false because when i didnt place this it has an error because it can read properties of null (based on the error) so with the use of the code below i was able to check if the userData  is null or not
